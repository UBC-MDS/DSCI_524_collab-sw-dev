## Lecture 1:
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Create project boards using GitHub and link tasks to issues
- Create GitHub milestones to group related issues
- Set-up master branch protection on a GitHub repository
- Use branching and pull requests to propose changes to the master branch
- Compare and contrast the Git and GitHub flow development workflows

## Lecture 2: 
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Explain the circumstances in which one should consider creating a package for their code
- Name the key files and directories in both R & Python pacakges and describe the function of each
- Given a function and a unit test written in R, use `devtools` and `usethis` to create a small and simple R package
- Given a function and a unit test written in Python, use a Cookiecutter template and `poetry` to create a small and simple Python package


## Lecture 3: 
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Perform a code review that uses inline comments and suggested code fixes
- Define the following 3 types of testing:
    - unit testing
    - integration testing
    - regression testing
- Employ a workflow that optimizes accurate code.
- Write unit tests for complex objects (e.g., data frames, models, plots)
- Use `pytest` and `testhat` to run a project's entire test suite
- Explain how `pytest` and `testthat` find the test functions when they are asked to run a project's entire test suite

## Lecture 4:
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Define code, test and branch coverage. Explain why high coverage in each of these metrics is desired
- Calculate code coverage in R and Python
- Manage package dependencies in R and Python packages
- Create a reprex to get help
- How to use a reprex to get help
- Use `traceback`, `options(error = recover)`, and `browser` to debug R code
- Use `traceback.print_tb`, `pdb.pm()`, `code.interact()` and `pdb.run` to debug Python code

## Lecture 5:
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
- Generate well formatted function and package-level documentation for R using Roxygen and `pkgdown`
- Generate well formatted function and package-level documentation for Python packages using Sphinx & Read the Docs
