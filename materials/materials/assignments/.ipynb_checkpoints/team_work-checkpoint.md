# DSCI 524 Team project reflection
rubric={reasoning:100}

The purpose of this individual report is to give you an avenue to present your viewpoint as to how the project went, how the group worked together, and your role in the group. Each group member must complete this form to report on the contributions of **yourself** and the other group members. That information can, if needed, be used to adjust final grades of individuals. This is a private report, meaning that none of your classmates will see this report.
