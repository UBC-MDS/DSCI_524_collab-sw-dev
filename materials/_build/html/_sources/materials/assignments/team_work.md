*You can acces an editable version of this file [here](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2020-21/DSCI_524_collab-sw-dev_students/blob/master/materials/materials/assignments/team_work.md).*

The purpose of this individual report
is to give you an avenue to present your viewpoint
as to how the project went,
how the group worked together,
and your role in the group.
Each group member must complete this form
to report on the contributions of **yourself** and the other group members.
That information can be used to adjust final grades of individuals,
if needed.
This is a private report,
meaning that none of your classmates will see your submission.

For each of the sections below,
evaluate each member of your group by writing the number
that best reflects the extent to which they participated,
prepared, helped the group excel, and was a team player.
Use the following ratings:

| 3      | Frequently (more often than not)        |
