    "  2. add the function to your packages namespace so that you can just refer to it as your normally would. To do this add `@importFrom <package_name> <function_or_operator>` to the Roxygen documentation of the function that you would like to use the function from the other package in and then use `document()` to update the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE file. \n",
