Remove the testing of package versions from the test file (this was added to the cookiecutter template by mistake and interferes with the automated version bumping).\n",

The reason for this, is that this workflow (which bumps versions and deploy the package) is triggered to run **after** the pull request is merged to main. Therefore, when we bump the versions in the `pyproject.toml` file and the `package/__init__.py` file (the two places in our package where the version must be stored) we need to push these changes to the main branch - however this is problematic given that we have set-up main branch protection!\n",
